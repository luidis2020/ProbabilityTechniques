## General Step

### An analytical method applied to probabilistic power flow

- A power flow calculation using expected values for all variables
- Determine a Jacobian for previous calculation, this matrix relates desired variables (e.g. voltage and angle) with power injection that contains uncertain variables (e.g. photovoltaic power generation). In other words, desired variables can be expressed as a linear combination of uncertain variables.
